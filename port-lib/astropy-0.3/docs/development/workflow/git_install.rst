 Installing git
===============

The instructions here are adapted from http://book.git-scm.com/2_installing_git.html

Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

::

    sudo apt-get install git-core

Fedora
------

::

    sudo yum install git-core

MacOS X
-------

There are several ways to install git on Mac. The easiest is to simply download the OS X installer (git-osx-installer_). If you have MacPorts installed, you can also do::

    sudo port install git-core

If you have Fink installed, you can do::

    sudo apt-get install git

In addition, you may want to use a GUI to manage your git repositories. A good example of a free Mac GUI is `GitX <http://gitx.frim.nl/>`_. Other (non-free) examples include `Tower <http://www.git-tower.com/>`_ and `SourceTree <http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>`_. GitHub have also recently released `GitHub for Mac <http://mac.github.com/>`_.

Windows
